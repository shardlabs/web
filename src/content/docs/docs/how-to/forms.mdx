title: Forms (MVP)
description: Build simple data‑entry forms mapped directly to a table in your shard
---

Forms let you build Microsoft Access‑style forms for data entry. Today, each form targets a single table with a 1:1 mapping to columns. Soon, forms will be shareable and fillable outside your workspace for things like questionnaires and waitlists.

## What you can do today

- Create and edit forms tied to a single table
- Configure fields, validations, and required flags
- Choose common input types (text, number, email, tel, url, password, textarea, checkbox, radio, select)
- Reorder fields and manage select/radio options
- Enable/disable the form and customize the submission success message
- Submit data through the form; new records are written to the target table

## Open the Forms panel

- From the left sidebar, click the book icon to open the Forms drawer.
- Open an existing form or create a new one. A "Form" panel tab will open.

## Create a new form

1. With a shard selected, open the Forms panel and choose New.
2. Fill in Basic Information:
   - Name (required)
   - Optional description
   - Target Table (required)
3. Add form fields:
   - Label (required)
   - Field Type (required): text, number, password, email, tel, url, textarea, checkbox, radio, select
   - Target Column (required): column in the selected table (system column `_iid` is excluded)
   - Optional placeholder and validation (min, max, minLength, maxLength, pattern)
   - Required toggle
   - For radio/select, add at least one option (label + value)
   - Reorder fields with Up/Down controls; remove fields with the trash icon
4. Settings:
   - Form enabled: toggle availability
   - Allow duplicate submissions from same IP
   - Success message shown after submit
5. Click Save to create the form.

## Edit vs. Preview

- Preview: see the end‑user experience and submit test data
- Edit: change the schema and settings; click Update Form to save
- If a form has no fields yet, the panel auto‑switches to Edit to guide setup

## Submitting data

- In Preview, fill out the form and click Submit
- Required fields are validated client‑side; missing values show a toast message
- On success, you’ll see the configured success message and can “Submit another response”
- The target table is updated via the API, and related table views in the UI automatically refresh

## Current limitations

- 1:1 mapping with a single table per form
- No external sharing yet (coming soon)
- Advanced logic (conditionals, branching) not yet available
- File uploads and multi‑table writes are not supported

## Coming soon

- Public share links and embeddable forms
- Conditional logic and computed fields
- Additional actions (e.g., automations on submit)
