description: Run ad‑hoc SQL queries against your shard’s database right from the UI
---

The SQL Editor lets you run arbitrary SQL against your shard’s Postgres database and inspect the results without leaving Shard. It’s ideal for quick lookups, debugging, and maintenance queries.

## Open the SQL Editor

- From the left sidebar, click the database icon labeled "SQL Editor" to open a new SQL panel.
- A new tab titled "SQL Editor" will appear in your workspace.

## Run a query

1. Enter a SQL statement in the editor pane. A starter example is provided, e.g.:
   - `SELECT * FROM your_table LIMIT 10;`
2. Click "Run Query" (play icon) to execute.
3. Results appear in the lower section:
   - For SELECT statements, results are rendered in a read‑only grid.
   - For INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE and other non‑SELECT statements, an info banner shows rows affected and/or the last insert ID.

### Errors

If a query fails, an error banner shows the message. Your SQL remains in the editor so you can revise and re‑run.

## Tips

- You must select a shard before running queries.
- The grid columns are derived from the first row’s keys, so return consistent shapes when possible.
- The internal `_iid` column is reserved and used as the row identifier in result grids.

## Notes & limits

- Queries execute against your shard via the API; use caution with destructive statements.
- Long‑running queries cannot currently be cancelled from the UI.
- Results are view‑only in this panel (no inline editing).
