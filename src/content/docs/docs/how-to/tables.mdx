Tables in Shard are Postgres tables that store your data. They provide a familiar spreadsheet-like interface for viewing, editing, and managing structured data with full SQL capabilities under the hood.

## What are Shard Tables?

Each table in Shard is a standard Postgres table with:

- **Typed columns** that support common Postgres data types (text, integer, numeric/decimal, boolean, timestamp, jsonb)
- **SQL query support** for complex filtering and operations
- **Real-time updates** when running in "Live" mode

Tables are the foundation for most Shard features like automations, forms, and charts.

## Creating Tables

### Creating a New Table

1. **Open the Tables sidebar** by clicking the tables icon in the left panel
2. **Click "New"** in the top-right corner
3. **Enter a table name** (e.g., `users`, `orders`, `events`)
4. **Click "Create"**

Your new table will appear in the tables list and automatically open in a new panel.

### Importing from CSV

1. **Open the Tables sidebar**
2. **Click "Import CSV"**
3. **Select your CSV file**
4. **Choose import options**:
   - Create a new table from the CSV structure
   - Append to an existing table
   - Map CSV columns to table columns
5. **Click "Import"**

## Working with Table Data

### The Table Panel

When you open a table, you'll see a spreadsheet-like interface with:

- **Toolbar** at the top with actions and controls
- **Column headers** showing field names
- **Data grid** with rows and cells
- **Selection checkboxes** for bulk operations
- **Pagination controls** to navigate through data

### Adding Rows

1. **Click the "+ Add Row" button** in the toolbar
2. A **new empty row** appears at the top of the table
3. **Click into any cell** to start entering data
4. **Press Tab** to move to the next cell
5. **Click outside the cell or press Enter** to confirm the value
6. **Click "Save Changes"** when done to persist the new row

### Editing Cells

1. **Click on any cell** to begin editing
2. **Type your new value** in the input field
3. **Click outside the cell or press Enter** to confirm
4. **Changed cells are highlighted** to show unsaved modifications
5. **The toolbar shows a badge** indicating the number of pending changes
6. **Click "Save Changes"** to commit all edits at once
7. **Click "Discard Changes"** to revert all unsaved modifications

**Note**: Changes are tracked locally until you explicitly save them. This allows you to make multiple edits and save them as a batch.

### Deleting Rows

**Delete a single row:**
1. **Right-click on a row** to open the context menu
2. **Select "Delete row"**
3. **Confirm the deletion** in the dialog

**Delete multiple rows:**
1. **Check the boxes** next to the rows you want to delete
2. **Click the trash icon** in the selection menu that appears
3. **Confirm the deletion** when prompted

### Managing Columns

**Add a new column:**
1. **Click the menu (⋮)** in the toolbar
2. **Select "New Column"**
3. **Enter the column name and type**
4. **Click "Add"**

**Rename a column:**
1. **Click the menu (⋮)** on a column header
2. **Select "Rename Column"**
3. **Enter the new name**
4. **Click "Rename"**

**Delete a column:**
1. **Click the menu (⋮)** on a column header
2. **Select "Delete Column"**
3. **Confirm the deletion** (this cannot be undone)

## Pagination

Tables are paginated to improve performance with large datasets:

- **Page size**: 100 rows per page by default
- **Navigation**: Use the **← Previous** and **Next →** buttons in the toolbar
- **Page indicator**: Shows the current range (e.g., "1–100 of 5,432")
- **Automatic loading**: The next page loads when you click "Next"

You can navigate through thousands of rows efficiently without loading all data at once.

## Live Mode

Toggle **Live mode** in the toolbar to control real-time updates:

- **Live** (green indicator): The table automatically refreshes to show new data as it arrives
- **Idle** (gray indicator): The table is frozen at the current state and won't update

Live mode is useful when monitoring feeds or automations that continuously insert data.

## Filtering Data

1. **Click the filter icon** in the toolbar
2. **Build filter rules** using the visual query builder:
   - Select a column
   - Choose an operator (equals, contains, greater than, etc.)
   - Enter a value to match
3. **Combine multiple rules** with AND/OR logic
4. **Click "Apply"** to filter the table
5. **Click the filter icon again** to clear filters

Filters use SQL `WHERE` clauses under the hood for efficient querying.

## Selection and Bulk Actions

- **Select individual rows** by checking their checkboxes
- **Select all rows** on the current page using the header checkbox
- When rows are selected, a **selection menu appears** with bulk actions:
  - **Delete selected rows**
  - **Clear selection**

## Advanced Features

### Table Menu Actions

Click the **⋮ menu** in the toolbar for additional options:

- **New Column**: Add a new field to the table
- **Import CSV**: Bulk import data from a CSV file
- **Automations**: View and create automations for this table
- **Delete Table**: Permanently remove the table (requires confirmation)

### Automations Integration

Tables can trigger automations when rows are inserted or updated. See the [Automations documentation](/docs/automations) for details on creating event-driven workflows.

### SQL Queries

While the table panel provides a visual interface, you can also query tables directly using SQL in the SQL Editor. Shard uses the Postgres SQL dialect.

## Tips and Best practices

- **Use descriptive column names** (e.g., `user_email` instead of `e`)
- **Choose appropriate data types** for efficient storage and querying
- **Save changes frequently** to avoid losing edits
- **Add indexes** (via SQL) for columns you filter or join frequently
- **Back up important data** before bulk delete operations
