description: Export your Shard data
---

You can export your entire Shard as a SQL file at any time. This creates a complete backup of all your tables, data, and schema that can be imported into any Postgres‑compatible database.

## How to Export

1. **Open Settings** from the left sidebar
2. **Click "Export Shard"**
3. **Choose a location** to save the `.sql` file
4. Your export will download immediately

The exported SQL file contains all table definitions, indexes, and data from your Shard. You can use this file to:

- **Back up your data** for safekeeping
- **Migrate to another database** system
- **Share your Shard structure** with others
- **Restore data** after testing or development

## What's Included

The export includes:

- All table schemas (column names, types, constraints)
- All row data from every table
- Indexes and other database objects
- Postgres‑compatible SQL statements

## Using Your Export

The exported `.sql` file can be imported into:

- Another Shard instance
- Postgres command‑line tools (for example: `psql "$CONNECTION_URL" -f export.sql`)
- Database management applications
- Any Postgres‑compatible system
