Charts help you visualize your Shard data with interactive line graphs. Create charts to monitor trends, track metrics over time, and gain insights from your tables.

**Note**: Currently, only **Line Charts** are supported. Additional chart types (bar, pie, map) are coming soon.

## Creating a Line Chart

### Step 1: Open a New Chart

1. **Click the Charts icon** in the left sidebar
2. **Click "New"** to create a new chart
3. You'll see the chart creation interface

### Step 2: Choose Your Visualization

When creating a new chart, you'll see visualization options:

- **Line** - Shows trends over time (currently supported)
- **Bar** - Compares quantities (coming soon)
- **Pie** - Shows proportions (coming soon)
- **Map** - Displays geographical data (coming soon)

**Click "Line"** and then **"Next"** to continue.

### Step 3: Configure Your Chart

**Set a Title**:
- Enter a descriptive title like "Requests over time" or "User signups by day"
- This appears at the top of your chart

**Add Data Series**:

A series is a line on your chart. You can add multiple series to compare different data sources.

1. **Click "Add series"** to create your first series
2. **Configure each series**:
   - **Label**: Name for this line (e.g., "Active users")
   - **Table**: Which table to pull data from
   - **X axis**: Column for horizontal axis (usually time/date)
   - **Y axis**: Column for vertical axis (the value to plot)
   - **Max points**: Limit how many data points to display (default and maximum: 200)
   - **Filter**: Optional rules to filter which rows to include

3. **Add more series** if you want to compare multiple metrics on the same chart

### Step 4: Save Your Chart

1. **Click "Save chart"** at the bottom
2. Your chart will render with the configured data
3. The chart appears in the Charts list and can be opened anytime

## Working with Charts

### Viewing a Chart

Once created, your chart displays:

- **Title** at the top
- **Legend** showing all series names
- **Interactive graph** where you can hover to see exact values
- **Live/Idle toggle** to control real-time updates
- **Edit button** to modify the chart configuration

### Live Mode

Toggle **Live mode** in the bottom toolbar:

- **Live** (green indicator): Chart refreshes every 60 seconds with new data
- **Idle** (gray indicator): Chart is frozen and won't auto-refresh

Live mode is useful for monitoring real-time metrics like request counts or active sessions.

### Editing a Chart

1. **Open the chart** from the Charts sidebar
2. **Click "Edit"** in the bottom-right corner
3. **Modify** the title, series, or filters
4. **Click "Save changes"** to update the chart

### Deleting a Chart

Charts can be deleted from the Charts sidebar by right-clicking on a chart and selecting "Delete" (feature may vary based on UI implementation).

## Chart Series Configuration

### Choosing the Right Fields

**X Axis (Horizontal)**:
- Typically a **time or date column** (e.g., `created_at`, `timestamp`)
- Can also be sequential IDs or any ordered value
- Shard automatically detects whether to use time-based or value-based scaling

**Y Axis (Vertical)**:
- The **metric you want to track** (e.g., `count`, `total`, `revenue`)
- Numeric columns work best
- Text columns will be ignored or cause errors

### Using Filters

Filters let you narrow down which rows appear in your chart:

1. **Click "Add rule"** in the Filter section
2. **Select a column** to filter by
3. **Choose an operator** (equals, greater than, contains, etc.)
4. **Enter a value** to match
5. **Combine rules** with AND/OR logic

**Example**: Only show data where `status = "completed"` AND `priority > 5`

### Max Points Limit

The **Max points** setting controls how many data points are fetched:

- Shard enforces a limit of 200 points per series to ensure responsive charts
- Use filters (time ranges, predicates) to focus on the most relevant data

If your table has many rows, consider tightening your filters to keep the visualization clear and fast.

## Multiple Series

You can overlay multiple lines on one chart to compare trends:

**Example Use Cases**:
- Compare **new users** vs **active users** over time
- Track **requests** and **errors** on the same timeline
- Show **revenue** from different product categories

Each series can pull from:
- **Different tables**
- **Different columns**
- **Different time ranges** (via filters)

All series share the same X and Y axis scales for easy comparison.

## Tips for Better Charts

**Choose descriptive names**: Label your series clearly so others can understand them

**Use consistent time intervals**: If plotting time-based data, ensure your X axis column has regular timestamps

**Filter out noise**: Use filters to exclude test data, outliers, or irrelevant rows

**Start simple**: Create a basic chart first, then add complexity with additional series and filters

**Check your data types**: Ensure Y axis columns are numeric (integers or decimals)

**Use Live mode wisely**: Only enable it when monitoring real-time data to avoid unnecessary resource usage

## Common Issues

**Chart shows no data**:
- Verify your table has rows matching your filters
- Check that X and Y axis columns exist and have values
- Ensure Y axis values are numeric

**Chart looks jagged or sparse**:
- Your data might have gaps in the X axis timeline
- Consider increasing the max points limit
- Check if filters are too restrictive

**Chart won't save**:
- At least one complete series is required (table, X axis, and Y axis must all be set)
- Ensure you have a valid shard selected

## Example: Creating a Request Count Chart

1. **Create a chart** and select Line type
2. **Set title**: "API Requests Over Time"
3. **Add series**:
   - Label: "Requests"
   - Table: `api_logs`
   - X axis: `timestamp`
   - Y axis: `request_count`
   - Max points: 200
   - Filter: `status = 200` (only successful requests)
4. **Save** and watch your request trends over time!

You now have a live dashboard showing API request volume with automatic updates every minute when Live mode is enabled.
