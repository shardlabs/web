Shard's billing and subscription management is handled securely through Stripe.

## Managing Your Subscription

You can manage your Shard subscription at any time:

- **View billing details** in your account settings
- **Update payment methods** directly through the billing portal
- **Cancel your subscription** anytime with no penalties or fees

To access your billing portal, use the account menu (top right) and navigate to **Manage Account â†’ Billing** in the Shard app.

## Usage Limits

Usage limits are currently **not actively enforced**, but will be implemented in the future. Staying under these limits is your responsibility.

**To check your current usage:**
1. Open **Settings** from the left sidebar
2. Click the **Stats** button
3. View your current storage, API calls, and other metrics

## Payment & Security

All payment processing is handled by **Stripe**, an industry-leading payment platform. Shard does not store your credit card information directly.
