description: A 30 second intro to Shard

import { CardGrid, LinkCard } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

Shard is a new kind of data workspace: part terminal, part dashboard, part playground. It combines the power of SQLite databases with a modern visual interface for managing tables, creating automations, and building charts.

## What is Shard?

Shard gives you a flexible environment to:

- **Store and manage data** in SQLite tables with a spreadsheet-like interface
- **Automate workflows** with event-driven rules that respond to data changes
- **Visualize trends** using interactive charts and dashboards
- **Query directly** with full SQL support when you need it

Think of it as your personal data workspace—whether you're prototyping an app, tracking metrics, or building custom workflows.

## Getting Started

Here are some of the features you can explore:

<CardGrid >
<LinkCard href="/docs/how-to/tables"  title="Tables" description='Create and manage SQLite tables with a visual interface. Add rows, edit cells, paginate through data, and filter with a query builder.' />
<LinkCard href="/docs/how-to/automations"  title="Automations" description='Build event-driven workflows that trigger actions when your data changes. Send webhooks, create rows, and chain complex logic using visual rules.' />
<LinkCard href="/docs/how-to/charts"  title="Charts" description='Visualize your data with line charts. Track metrics over time, compare multiple series, and monitor trends in real-time.' />
<LinkCard href="/docs/how-to/export"  title="Export" description='Back up your entire Shard as a SQL file. Export your data at any time for safekeeping or migration.' />

</CardGrid>
