_Last updated: October 9, 2025_

Your privacy matters to us. This Privacy Policy explains how shard.sh (“we,” “us,” or “our”) collects, uses, and protects your information when you use Shard (“the Service”).

By using Shard, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy.

## 1. Information We Collect

We collect information to operate and improve Shard. The information we collect falls into three main categories:

### 1.1 Information You Provide

- Account information: such as your name, email address, and password.
- Data in your shards: content, tables, records, automations, or other information you upload or create.
- Billing details: if you subscribe to a paid plan, we collect payment information (processed securely by our payment provider).
- Communications: if you contact us via email or support chat, we keep those communications to help resolve issues.

### 1.2 Information We Collect Automatically

When you use Shard, we may automatically collect:

- Log data (e.g., IP address, browser type, pages visited, timestamps).
- Usage data (e.g., API calls, query counts, or performance metrics).
- Device and connection information (e.g., operating system, screen size).

We use this information to keep the platform secure, debug issues, and improve performance.

### 1.3 Cookies and Analytics

We may use cookies or similar technologies to:

- Keep you signed in.
- Remember your preferences.
- Measure usage and improve the product.

You can control cookies through your browser settings.

## 2. How We Use Your Information

We use your information to:

- Provide, maintain, and improve the Shard platform.
- Process billing and manage subscriptions.
- Communicate with you about updates, security, or support.
- Monitor usage for fraud prevention and performance.
- Develop new features and enhancements.

We never sell your personal data.

## 3. How We Share Information

We only share your information in limited circumstances:

- With service providers: such as hosting, analytics, or payment vendors who help us operate the Service.
- For legal reasons: if required by law or in response to lawful requests.
- With your consent: when you explicitly choose to share or publish data (for example, sharing a shard or embedding a form).

All service providers are required to handle data securely and only use it for the purposes we authorize.

## 4. Data Ownership and Retention

You own the data you upload to Shard. We only process it to operate the platform.

If you delete your account or individual shards, we will delete or anonymize associated data within a reasonable period, except where retention is required for legal, accounting, or security reasons.

Backups may persist for a short time after deletion but are automatically purged.

## 5. Data Security

We use industry-standard encryption (HTTPS/TLS) to protect your data in transit and at rest. Access to production systems is restricted to authorized personnel only.

While we take strong measures to safeguard your data, no system is completely secure. You are responsible for maintaining secure passwords and safeguarding access tokens or API keys.

## 6. International Data Transfers

Your information may be processed and stored in the United States or other countries where our infrastructure or service providers operate. By using Shard, you consent to such transfers.

## 7. Your Rights

Depending on your location, you may have rights to:

- Access, correct, or delete your personal data.
- Export a copy of your data.
- Withdraw consent or object to certain processing.
