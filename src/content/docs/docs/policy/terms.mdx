---

_Last updated: October 9, 2025_

Welcome to Shard (“the Service”), operated by shard.sh (“we,” “us,” or “our”). By using Shard, you agree to these Terms of Service (“Terms”). Please read them carefully.

## 1. Overview

Shard provides a platform that allows users to create, manage, and query personal databases (“shards”). Users can store structured and unstructured data, define relationships, and automate actions based on rules or events.

By accessing or using Shard, you agree to comply with these Terms and our Privacy Policy (the “Policies”). If you do not agree, do not use the Service.

## 2. Eligibility

You must be at least 16 years old to use Shard. If you use Shard on behalf of an organization, you represent that you have authority to bind that organization to these Terms.

## 3. Your Account

You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your login credentials and for all activity that occurs under your account. If you suspect unauthorized use, notify us immediately.

We may suspend or terminate your account if we believe it has been compromised or used in violation of these Terms.

## 4. Your Data

You own your data. When you use Shard, you grant us a limited license to store, process, and display your data solely to provide and improve the Service.

You are responsible for ensuring that the data you upload:

- does not violate any laws or regulations; and
- does not infringe on any intellectual property or privacy rights.

We do not claim ownership over the content stored in your shards.

## 5. Data Storage and Usage Limits

Shard offers both free and paid tiers. Free plans include up to 10,000 records per shard and limited storage. Paid plans provide expanded capacity and server-side querying.

We may impose reasonable technical limits to maintain performance and stability.

## 6. Acceptable Use

You agree not to:

- use Shard for unlawful, harmful, or fraudulent purposes;
- upload malicious code, spam, or excessive automated traffic;
- reverse engineer or attempt to gain unauthorized access to our systems; or
- interfere with or disrupt other users’ shards or infrastructure.

We reserve the right to remove or suspend accounts that violate these rules.

## 7. Service Availability

We aim to keep Shard available at all times, but uptime is not guaranteed. Planned maintenance or unexpected outages may occur. We are not liable for any data loss or downtime, though we will make reasonable efforts to notify you in advance of planned disruptions.

## 8. Billing and Payments

Paid plans are billed in advance on a recurring basis (monthly or annually). By subscribing, you authorize us to charge your chosen payment method until you cancel.

You may cancel at any time, and your subscription will remain active until the end of the billing period. Refunds are not guaranteed.

## 9. Intellectual Property

The Shard platform, including software, design, and trademarks, remains the property of shard.sh. You may not copy, modify, or distribute our code, branding, or content without written permission.

## 10. Termination

You may stop using Shard at any time. We may suspend or terminate your account if you violate these Terms or engage in activities that harm the Service or other users.

Upon termination, your access will cease. We may retain data for a limited time for backup and compliance purposes.

## 11. Disclaimer of Warranties

Shard is provided “as is” and “as available.” We make no warranties—express or implied—regarding reliability, security, or fitness for a particular purpose.

Use Shard at your own risk.

## 12. Limitation of Liability

To the maximum extent permitted by law, shard.sh shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, or consequential damages resulting from your use of the Service—including data loss, downtime, or lost profits.

Our total liability shall not exceed the amount you paid to us in the past six months.

## 13. Changes to These Terms

We may update these Terms periodically. When we do, we’ll update the “Last updated” date above. Continued use of Shard after changes become effective means you accept the revised Terms.
