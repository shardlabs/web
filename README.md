# Shard

Shard is a new kind of data workspace: part terminal, part dashboard, part playground. It pairs managed Postgres databases (one per Shard) with a modern visual interface for managing tables, creating automations, and building charts.

## What is Shard?

Shard gives you a flexible environment to:

- **Store and manage data** in Postgres tables with a spreadsheet-like interface
- **Automate workflows** with event-driven rules that respond to data changes
- **Visualize trends** using interactive charts and dashboards
- **Query directly** with full SQL support when you need it

Think of it as your personal data workspaceâ€”whether you're prototyping an app, tracking metrics, or building custom workflows.
